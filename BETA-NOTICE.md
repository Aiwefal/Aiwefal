# What you need to know

This is an open beta build of an advanced private server template for Arras.io, independent from the official client. If you're familiar with `arras-template`, you'll be familiar with this.

This is **not** representative of the final product.

Some things may not either be present or work correctly.

Some custom tanks are available to play around with, but I don't know if they'll be included in the final version.

- Most of these are either ported from Woomy-Arras, made up by someone else, or are older tanks not included in Retrograde or Arms Race.
